This repository contains a collection of projects created to practice and deepen my knowledge in industrial automation and PLC programming. The primary goal of these projects is to simulate real-world manufacturing environments and implement various automation concepts. To achieve this, I used Factory IO for creating realistic process simulations and TIA Portal for programming PLCs and designing HMIs.
