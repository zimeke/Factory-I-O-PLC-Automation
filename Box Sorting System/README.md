# Box Sorting System

This project simulates a simple box sorting process using a conveyor belt, sensor, and a pusher. The system is designed to detect large boxes passing through the conveyor belt. When a large box is detected, the sensor activates the pusher device, which pushes the box off the belt. Smaller boxes are not detected by the sensor and will not trigger the pusher mechanism. The process can be started with a start button and stopped with a stop button and an emergency button. The system also includes status lamps that provide visual feedback on the current process state. This project demonstrates basic automation concepts, including sensor integration, actuator control, and user interface functionality.
